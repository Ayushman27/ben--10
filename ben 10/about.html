                <h2>1. Alien X</h2>
                <p class="description">Despite just speaking of an alien that harnesses atomic energy, it is Alien X which is the strongest of 
                    all aliens within the Omnitrix. It is the DNA sample of a Celestialsapien, a species of omnipotent beings 
                    with the abilities to do anything that they desire. This may seem overpowered, and to a degree it is, but 
                    there is a caveat to this immense power. Within every Celestialsapien is two personalities 
                    (or in Ben’s case, three) and all personalities must agree on a task before anything happens. This is true 
                    for even the most basic of tasks like moving, which can make for a difficult time when attempting to fight an 
                    enemy in fast combat. As such, it is rare for Ben to actually use Alien X, and his transformation into the alien 
                    is normally reserved for dire times when he needs an incredible edge against his opponents. Nevertheless, it has
                     been shown to be his most powerful alien such as when he convinced the personalities to help him create a near-identical
                      copy of the universe when the original one was destroyed.</p>

                <h2>2. Atomix</h2>
                <p class="description">When your powers revolve around the creation and manipulation of atomic energy, it shouldn’t be 
                    questioned how powerful you are. That is precisely the case for Ben 10's Atomix, who can use 
                    pure energy to obliterate enemies with ease. He also has the ability to generate gamma radiation
                     and nuclear energy which can be harnessed into an orb projectile. He can also activate the 
                     cylinders along his body to melt nearby objects, making him dangerous to approach. Atomix has 
                     the ability to fly, and his strength is so vast that just one kick can send an object close to 
                     outside a planet’s atmosphere. With such raw power, however, comes a great stamina cost that 
                     can leave Atomix feeling drained. In addition, these powers are incredibly devastating, meaning
                      that it’s difficult to contain the damage that they can do.</p>

                <img src="images/Diamondhead.avif" alt="Alien Name">
                <h2>3. Diamondhead</h2>
                <p class="description">The original series was good at creating aliens that were simple, yet memorable, and Diamondhead 
                    was one of the ones that perhaps stood out the most. His body is entirely composed of pale green
                     crystals that he can manipulate the form of at will. This allows him to shift his arms into a 
                     variety of weapons to attack with, as well as using them for protection. Diamondhead can also 
                     shoot crystal shards from his body, making for a lethal ranged option when he can’t get close.
                      He can construct crystals as well, allowing for him to litter the battlefield with potential 
                      cover or large projectiles. His body is extremely durable and can absorb pure energy as well 
                      as refract lasers away from him. Despite his simple design, Diamondhead was another staple 
                      alien that Ben used because of the raw versatility that his kit offered him.</p>

                <img src="images/Ampfibian.avif" alt="Alien Name">
                <h2>4. Ampfibian</h2>
                <p class="description">The best way to describe Ampfibian is to compare them to a jellyfish. He has the ability to absorb
                     electrical energy which can then be shot back out through his extendable tentacles. Ampfibian is 
                     more than capable of producing energy himself too, so he isn’t reliant on just absorbing the attacks 
                     of his foes. He can also breathe underwater and has incredible swimming capabilities. In addition, 
                     Ampfibian can make himself intangible, which paired with the ability to fly can make him a difficult
                      target to hit. He also has the ability to read the minds of humans by sensing the electrical pulses
                       of their brains.</p>

                <img src="images/Clockwork.avif" alt="Alien Name">
                <h2>5. Clockwork</h2>
                <p class="description">Clockwork has the ability to fire green time streamers with diverse effects, including sending 
                    objects or people back in time, turning them into dust, restoring time-erased entities, transporting
                    them to a different timeline, or immobilizing them at an earlier point. Clockwork can manipulate 
                    time perception by slowing it down, creating an appearance of moving at high speed to outsiders. 
                    The winding crown on its head allows Clockwork to view recent past events through holographic 
                    projections. As a robotic being, Clockwork can survive in the vacuum of space. Additionally, a 
                    galvanic mechamorph fusion enhances its time streams, providing superhuman speed, endurance, high 
                    jumps, drill hands, missile launchers, and the ability to detect other Clockwork winding crowns.</p>

                <h2>6. Gravattack</h2>
                <p class="description">Gravattack possesses the ability to control gravity, allowing manipulation of the weight and
                     movement of objects. Additionally, Gravattack can punch the ground effortlessly and create
                      orbit attacks by causing matter or energy to circle around him when coiled into a planetoid 
                      sphere. This alien can even manipulate its own gravity, assuming a ball form and creating an 
                      orbit around itself.</p>

                <h2>7. Feedback</h2>
                <p class="description">Feedback possesses the unique ability to absorb any form of energy through its antennae, tail, and fingers.
                     It can unleash potent electric bolts from its hands, demonstrating versatility in combat. Feedback exhibits
                      exceptional agility, allowing it to maneuver through the air with flips and dodge enemy attacks effortlessly.
                       The alien can jump to great heights, avoiding ground-based assaults, and is resistant to electric shocks
                        when submerged in water. Furthermore, Feedback can release shocks by touching others with its antennae
                         or tail. Its lightning bolts are powerful enough to propel it, akin to how Swampfire employs fire for
                          propulsion.</p>

                <h2>8. Waybig</h2>
                <p class="description">Waybig possesses immense strength, able to launch targets into orbit and lift objects larger than himself,
                     showcasing his exceptional physical prowess. His durability is noteworthy, with the ability to withstand
                      enemy attacks and extreme temperatures. Waybig’s agility is demonstrated through high jumps and rapid
                       reflexes, reacting swiftly to threats. In close combat, he exhibits great skill, as observed in battles
                        against giant adversaries. Additionally, Waybig can unleash a potent cosmic ray from the outer edge of
                         his right hand, crossing his arms together, capable of overpowering formidable forces like the conquest
                         ray.</p>

                <h2>9. Ghostfreak</h2>
                <p class="description">Ghostfreak, an ectoplasmic entity, possesses the ability to turn invisible, phase through solid objects, 
                    and fly. It can manipulate its eye or head position across its form and has the capacity to inhabit and 
                    control other beings, although this ability is rarely utilized by Ben. Ghostfreak later acquires telekinesis 
                    and the capability to emit rays from its tentacles, potentially composed of plasma. The creature, sensitive 
                    to sunlight, is nearly incorporeal and can be easily destroyed by sunlight exposure. The original version of 
                    Ghostfreak features protective white skin divided into segments, concealing tentacles beneath. In the second 
                    iteration, reabsorbed by the Omnitrix, this protective skin is absent.</p>

                <h2>10. XLR8</h2>
                <p class="description">XLR8 possesses the ability to manipulate friction, allowing him to accelerate to speeds of 500 mph in two 
                    seconds. His remarkable speed is so intense that time seems to stop, granting him the capability to rearrange 
                    the positions of objects as he moves. As Kinecelerans age, their speed increases, exemplified by Ben 10,000’s 
                    ability to traverse the world in seconds. XLR8’s speed is visually imperceptible, requiring slow-motion 
                    capture to observe. He exhibits precise control over his velocity, enabling instant stops, distinguishing him
                     from Storm Chaser and Turbomanta. Additionally, XLR8 can think, act, and react at superhuman speeds,
                      performing tasks like typing rapidly and cracking codes with unparalleled efficiency.</p>

                <h2>11. Echo Echo</h2>
                <p class="description">Echo Echo possesses the ability to scream at ultrasonic frequencies, overloading machinery, shattering steel,
                     and stopping projectiles. He can duplicate himself rapidly, with clones not being linked, allowing strategic
                      use in battles. Echo Echo can create a wall of sound by redirecting projectiles with bouncing clones, and 
                      he can establish an echo chamber for coordinated attacks from all directions. Even if clones are defeated,
                       Echo Echo remains unharmed as long as at least one clone survives. This versatile combination of abilities
                        makes him formidable in various combat situations.</p>

                <h2>12. Chromastone</h2>
                <p class="description">Chromastone possesses the ability to allow various types of energy, such as lasers, electricity, mana, and 
                    radiation, to pass through his body harmlessly. He can absorb and channel this energy into ultraviolet rays,
                     capable of melting a truck trailer and destroying turrets. Chromastone can emit these rays from his hands or 
                     the shards on his body, using them as energy blasts or projectiles. The intensity of his attacks is adjustable,
                      and the power of his ultraviolet rays depends on the strength of the opponent’s energy. For instance, he 
                      subdued an alien dragon with a powerful wave of ultraviolet energy after absorbing its energy blast. 
                      Additionally, Chromastone can absorb mana from Gwen and unleash powerful energy blasts at formidable foes like
                       Diagon.</p>

                <h2>13. Humungousaur</h2>
                <p class="description">In its natural form, Humungousaur boasts superhuman strength and exceptional resistance to various physical
                     damages. His dinosaur-like appearance serves as an effective intimidation tactic, often leading opponents
                      to surrender. However, his large size becomes a drawback in confined spaces, limiting his use to open
                       terrains or situations demanding enhanced strength. Humungousaur can utilize his roar as a sonic weapon,
                        particularly effective underwater. Eugene suggests that Humungousaur is on par with Waybig in terms of 
                        strength, and the alien form can survive in space for a limited duration.</p>

                <h2>14. Big Chill</h2>
                <p class="description">Big Chill, the ghostly alien, possesses the ability to phase through solid objects while freezing them
                     in the process. This freezing effect occurs at the discretion of Big Chill, allowing him to choose 
                     whether to merely penetrate an object or freeze it simultaneously. When he penetrates creatures or 
                     objects, they experience an intense icy cold sensation. Big Chill can also emit an icy breath, 
                     enabling him to freeze things at a considerable distance. Additionally, the presence of Big Chill 
                     induces a sense of supernatural or chilling dread in sentient beings and shadow monsters.</p>
